1. Algorithm Validation & CorrectionThe Paper's Equation: The closed-form solution (Eq 16a) has a theoretical flaw. It treats the depth at $t-1$ ($d$) as a known constant. For objects moving longitudinally (away/toward the camera), this approximation fails, introducing systematic error even with perfect sensors.The Fix: We derived an Exact Corrected Solver by treating depth as a function of the unknown velocity ($d(\mathbf{t}) = d_{static} - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{t}$). This rearranges the linear algebra into a form $(M - C \otimes k) \cdot \mathbf{t} = B$, which solves for the velocity perfectly without approximation.2. The "Blind Spot" of Reprojection ErrorWe discovered that Reprojection Error is a necessary but insufficient metric for filtering noise. Its effectiveness depends entirely on the type of noise:Noise TypeDescriptionReprojection ErrorWhy?Multipath (Ghost)Wrong Position, "Correct" Velocity Magnitude.Low / Zero (in practice)The solver is "too good." It finds a specific (absurd) velocity that makes the underground ghost point perfectly track the optical flow of the road surface. Since it matches the background flow, the pixel error is 0.Random ClutterRandom Position, Random Velocity.Low / ZeroSame as above. The solver hallucinates a chaotic velocity vector to force the point to match the background flow.Doppler AmbiguityCorrect Position, Wrong Velocity (Aliased).Zero"Pencil of Rays" problem. If an object moves along the camera axis (depth), it projects to the same pixel regardless of speed. The visual constraint is satisfied even if the velocity is wrong by 30 m/s.3. The "Velocity Magnitude" InsightBecause the exact solver forces a mathematical fit between the Ghost Point and the Background Flow, the error is shifted from the Pixel Domain to the Velocity Domain.Real Points: Satisfy the flow with Normal Velocities (e.g., 0-30 m/s).Ghost/Noise Points: Satisfy the flow only by assuming Absurd Velocities (e.g., >100 m/s). This is due to the Parallax Effect—to make a distant ghost point move as fast as a nearby road pixel, it must physically move at supersonic speeds.
